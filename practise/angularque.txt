How can I load a template? Scenario -

labels and inputs for the user to input 
their address. I'd like to make use of this as 
part of two other forms which are part of two
 separate views.

In what scenario would you make use of a 
value, constant, factory, service or provider?

How would one implement routing?

How do I make an AJAX request?

How would you handle an asynchronous request? 

How would I add a custom directive?
